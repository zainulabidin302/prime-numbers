### Prime Numbers Anylisis

I have built this repository to build intuition about prime numbers. Doing so I discovered a very nice way to check if the number is prime.
I am not sure if it will work alway.

Here are some of the questions which I want to know.

  * Is there any range, inside which it is gauranteed to have a prime ? for example if we have a and b any arbitrary numbers, can we have a
    max constant b-a such that we will always find a prime before before we reach next prime number (prime number + (b-a)).
